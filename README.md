# Hands-on Fundamentals of Data Science with Go
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Fundamentals of Data Science with Go [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-fundamentals-data-science-go-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go (also known as Golang) is risingly proving to be faster execution, ease of codes and one of high efficiency programming language. With Data science domain being cumbersome with lots of data, data scientist and data engineers can take full advantage of Go's attributes and accomplish 90 percent of data science tasks faster and with high efficiency.
You will get complete hold on the use of statistics, linear algebra and understand in detail how you can boost your data science using Go. You will gain practical coverage on how to do data collection, data sanitation and munging, use of statistical models for analysis and data visualization. The video would also get you couple with the fundamentals of machine learning along with a quick run through in implementing models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM and so on. You will also get to know how you can work with big data processing tools like Apache Spark and Kafka in your data science projects. The course would also get you through couple of examples like recommendation system, sentimental analysis and stock prices forecasting.
